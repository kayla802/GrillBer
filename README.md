# GrillBer
Uber for Grills!

What is GrillBer (A Refresher)
GrillBer is exactly like it sounds: Uber for grills! Let me set the scene. You live in a dense urban environment, in a studio apartment on the 20th floor of an apartment building, but you want to put on a cookout! You don't have the space or the budget to buy a high quality grill, but your local park doesn't provide public access grills for your cookout. What do you do?

That's where GrillBer comes in! GrillBer is a rental and delivery service for grills! Grill renters can put up the specs and descriptions for their grills, and users can rent them for specific amounts of time! The grill owner will drop off the grill at the designated time and location, and then pick it back up when the user is finished!

# Step One
When you first enter the site, it would be a good idea to create a user profile if you havent already. If you clicked out of the automated pop-window click on "Sign Up" in the menu bar. After that, if you have a grill that you would like to rent-out to other users then add a new grill filling out the following required fields. 

# Step Two
Once you have created a grill, check the home page to see if your grill is on the master list of grills. If you see your Grill, click on it! Once clicked, you will enter the grills "Grill Page". While there, confirm that the info you previously entered is correct. This is what other users will see to determine if they would like to rent your grill. If there is anything you would like to change, go to the "Grills" tab in the menu bar and click on the dropdown option "My Grills". Once there, make sure you are the selected user and click "Find My Grills". You can then select your desired grill. When finished making changes, click "Edit Grill" to succesfully update your changes. Likewise, if you want to remove your grill from the database, you would click "Delete this Grill!" to succesfully remove.
